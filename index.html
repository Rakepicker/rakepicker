<p>A poker room's commission from a live or online poker game is called the 'rake'. You can't get any of this returned from a live game, but with online poker games you can, if you sign up with a reputable rakeback affiliate like RakeTheRake.</p>

<p>Online poker rooms make their money by automatically taking a cut of the players' stake money; this is the 'rake'. Typically the rake is 5% of every pot, you will often see it being taken and stacked at the top of the table during a game. Playing a few hundred hands a month soon accumulates a large amount of rake, and you could be paying tens of thousands of $$$ in rake a year. Most players don't realise they can get up to 75% of their rake money back with a rakeback affiliate.</p>

<a id="how-does-rakeback-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-rakeback-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does rakeback work?</h3>

<p>Here's how it works; we get paid by the poker rooms for bringing new players to their site. The commission we receive for signing you up to a poker room is based on the rake you generate by playing. We then give the majority of this commission back to you as rakeback.</p>

<a id="get-the-best-rakeback-deals" class="anchor" href="#get-the-best-rakeback-deals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Get the best rakeback deals</h3>

<p>To grab the best rakeback deals click the 'rakeback offers' button below and choose a top rakeback offer from our featured poker rooms. Follow our simple sign up guide and you'll be getting rakeback right away. If you're already playing at these rooms without a rakeback deal in place, sign up with another room on the same network to keep playing at the same online poker tables with the same players.</p>

<p>You can check your rakeback earnings daily by logging in to Your Account and viewing summary or detailed stats, You'll receive your rakeback money on time every month by your chosen payment option.</p>
