<p>A poker room's commission from a live or online poker game is called the 'rake'. You can't get any of this returned from a live game, but with online poker games you can, if you sign up with a reputable rakeback affiliate like RakeTheRake.</p>

<p>Online poker rooms make their money by automatically taking a cut of the players' stake money; this is the 'rake'. Typically the rake is 5% of every pot, you will often see it being taken and stacked at the top of the table during a game. Playing a few hundred hands a month soon accumulates a large amount of rake, and you could be paying tens of thousands of $$$ in rake a year. Most players don't realise they can get up to 75% of their rake money back with a rakeback affiliate.</p>

<p>Here's how it works; we get paid by the poker rooms for bringing new players to their site. The commission we receive for signing you up to a poker room is based on the rake you generate by playing. We then give the majority of this commission back to you as rakeback.</p>
