You can't get any of this returned from a live game, but with online poker games you can, if you sign up with a reputable rakeback affiliate like RakeTheRake.\r\n\r\nOnline poker rooms make their money by automatically taking a cut of the players' stake money; this is the 'rake'. Typically the rake is 5% of every pot, you will often see it being taken and stacked at the top of the table during a game. Playing a few hundred hands a month soon accumulates a large amount of rake, and you could be paying tens of thousands of $$$ in rake a year. Most players don't realise they can get up to 75% of their rake money back with a rakeback affiliate.\r\n\r\n###How does rakeback work?\r\n\r\nHere's how it works; we get paid by the poker rooms for bringing new players to their site. The commission we receive for signing you up to a poker room is based on the rake you generate by playing. We then give the majority of this commission back to you as rakeback.\r\n\r\n###Get the best rakeback deals\r\n\r\nTo grab the best rakeback deals click the 'rakeback offers' button below and choose a top rakeback offer from our featured poker rooms.

[+]\r\n####A: Some online poker sites do allow conversions of existing accounts. Contact us to find out if your poker site does!\r\n\r\n###Q: Should I make a poker account and then contact you to activate rakeback? [+]\r\n####A: If you make an account before signing up with RakeMeBack and receiving instructions, you will be considered a regular 'full' customer. This will likely prevent us from giving you rakeback for that site. Please contact us if you want more information.\r\n\r\n###Q: How do I make a rakeback account? [+]\r\n####A: You must first register a RakeMeBack user account. After you have logged in you can then add any number of deals to your account. The deals you have applied for will be displayed in an overview and for the majority of poker sites you will even be able to track the rake throughout the month.\r\n\r\n###Q: How do I receive the rakeback? [+]\r\n####A: The majority of our deals are automatic. This means that at a certain date-range every month the due rakeback is deposited by the poker site directly into your poker account. You can check the payment schedule for each poker site on RakeMeBack.com. Just go to the Review/ Information page for each poker room directly from the Rakeback Deals menu on our homepage.
