{"name":"Rakepiker","tagline":"Poker Afilliate web site","body":"# Welcome to RatePiker.\r\n\r\n###What is Rakeback?\r\n\r\nA poker room's commission from a live or online poker game is called the 'rake'. You can't get any of this returned from a live game, but with online poker games you can, if you sign up with a reputable rakeback affiliate like RakeTheRake.\r\n\r\nOnline poker rooms make their money by automatically taking a cut of the players' stake money; this is the 'rake'. Typically the rake is 5% of every pot, you will often see it being taken and stacked at the top of the table during a game. Playing a few hundred hands a month soon accumulates a large amount of rake, and you could be paying tens of thousands of $$$ in rake a year. Most players don't realise they can get up to 75% of their rake money back with a rakeback affiliate.\r\n\r\n###How does rakeback work?\r\n\r\nHere's how it works; we get paid by the poker rooms for bringing new players to their site. The commission we receive for signing you up to a poker room is based on the rake you generate by playing. We then give the majority of this commission back to you as rakeback.\r\n\r\n###Get the best rakeback deals\r\n\r\nTo grab the best rakeback deals click the 'rakeback offers' button below and choose a top rakeback offer from our featured poker rooms.

[+]\r\n####A: Some online poker sites do allow conversions of existing accounts.
